      p Welcome to the music explorer web app, your one-stop shop for music information!
        |This site is part of my senior project which is helping me gain experience in working with web apps.
        |Some of the technologies that I will be getting more familiar with here are:  

      ul
        li Node.JS
        li ExpressJS
        li Coffeescript
        li Jade
        li MongoDB
        li CSS
        li Web APIs
          ul
            li Google Maps
            li Last.fM
            li Bing
            li Amazon

      |It is my hope that all of these will come together to make a site where you
      |can go to find out about your favorite music and bands as well as 
      |discover new artists to follow.
